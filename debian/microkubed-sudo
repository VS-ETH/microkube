# microkube sudoers.d config file
# -------------------------------
# Kube proxy (iptables) and kubelet need root privileges
# Making hyperkube suid is unsafe, since it's not intended to be used that way and also a multi-call binary
# Making microkubed running as root is not a good idea since it doesn't actually need the privs and dropping them in
# golang is hard.
# Therefore we resort to sudo...
